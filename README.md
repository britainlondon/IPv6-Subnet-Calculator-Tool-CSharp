IPv6 Subnet Calculator / Tool Version 3.7

IPv6 Subnet Calculator / Tool application lets you plan/subnet your assigned address for all 128 bits.
We are in the transition phase from IPv4 to IPv6 addressing structure, and I believe that
the network engineers should easily plan their IPv6 addressing /subnetting infrastructure without any error.
For this purpose I decided to write and distribute an IPv6 Subnetting Tool / Calculator application
using Visual C# 2013 Express based on .NET 4 Framework.   
This application requires no installation and does not modify any registry or create any file.
I distributed the application in the hope that it will be useful for your subnet calculations.
I will try to continuously develop the software, so please don't hesitate to comment/inform for any bugs or new feature suggestions.
